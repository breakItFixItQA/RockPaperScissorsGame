# ✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors Game (Java)

This is a simple Java console application that simulates a game of **Rock, Paper, Scissors** between the user and the computer. The game accepts user input, generates a random computer choice, and then determines the winner based on standard game rules.

---

### 💡 What It Does

- Prompts the user to choose:
  - `0 = Rock`
  - `1 = Paper`
  - `2 = Scissors`
- Validates the user's input.
- Randomly generates a computer choice (also 0–2).
- Compares both choices to determine the winner:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Scissors beats Paper
  - Paper beats Rock
- Declares the result: user win, computer win, or a tie.

### 🛠 How to Run

1. Copy the code from `RockPaperScissorsGame.java` into your preferred Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code, etc.).
2. Compile and run the program.
3. Enter your choice when prompted.
